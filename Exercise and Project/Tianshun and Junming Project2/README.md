Collective Drums
🎨 Overview
Collective Drums is an interactive Flask web application that transforms individual user input into a shared rhythmic composition.
Each participant creates a 6×16 beat pattern, similar to programming a digital drum machine, and contributes it to a growing communal rhythm. The app visualizes these collective patterns through an evolving heatmap and displays recent participants, creating a living archive of sound and interaction.

💭 Concept
The project explores the relationship between individual expression and collective creation in a digital environment.
Each click represents a gesture of participation—an act of rhythm-making that, when combined with others, forms a dynamic portrait of communal tempo. Over time, the application becomes a visualization of shared presence: rhythm as memory, sound as data, and participation as art.
The minimalist interface is intentional, focusing attention on the emergent structure rather than design complexity.
Through repetition, randomness, and accumulation, Collective Drums invites users to reflect on how digital systems transform personal actions into collective experiences.
