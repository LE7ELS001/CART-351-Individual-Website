# CART-351 PROJECT III
A lightweight browser-based 1v1 fighting game built with real-time networking.  
Players join from any device on the same network, choose a name and color, and battle in a fast-paced arena.  
Match results are tracked and stored, contributing to a persistent leaderboard over time.

---------------

## 🎮 Overview
This project was created as part of a course exploring networked interaction and multiplayer systems.  
The goal was to build a game that feels immediate and responsive, while also maintaining a record of gameplay history.  
Although simple in mechanics, the system handles synchronization, real-time interaction, and shared state between two clients.
